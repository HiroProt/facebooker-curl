= Facebooker-curl

This is a curl-based version of Mike Mangino's excellent Facebooker library. We needed a more robust version of Facebooker that performs well and supports timeouts without the problems that Net::HTTP has in that area (http://blog.headius.com/2008/02/rubys-threadraise-threadkill-timeoutrb.html, http://ph7spot.com/articles/system_timer). Below is the original description of the facebooker project.

Facebooker is a Ruby wrapper over the Facebook[http://facebook.com] {REST API}[http://developer.facebook.com].  Its goals are:

* Idiomatic Ruby
* This version is dependent on libcurl and the Curb gem (This is true with Rails 2.1. Previous Rails versions also require the JSON gem)
* Concrete classes and methods modeling the Facebook data, so it's easy for a Rubyist to understand what's available
* Well tested

= Installing (Rails)

Facebooker-curl can be installed as a Rails plugin by:

  script/plugin install git@github.com:HiroProt/facebooker-curl.git

Once the plugin is installed, you will need to configure your Facebook app in config/facebooker.yml. 

Your application users will need to have added the application in facebook to access all of facebooker's features. You enforce this by adding

  ensure_application_is_installed_by_facebook_user  

to your application controller.


== Work in Progress

I'm not saying it meets its goals fully yet.  Please help.  I'm especially interested in feedback and criticism re: Ruby style and design and testing.  RCov has the library (at the time of this writing) at 100% coverage.  I take that with a grain of salt, but it's a good start.

== Contribute

Please visit the {RubyForge project page}[http://rubyforge.org/projects/facebooker] to get the latest source via svn, write some tests, add/fix features, and submit a patch via the tracker.  If you submit a good patch, it's likely that I'll add you to the project for commit access if you want to be added.
